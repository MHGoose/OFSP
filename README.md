# OFSP
 An Overly Friendly Servitor Personality for Rogue Servitor AIs in Stellaris, made on version 3.0.3.
 
## Background
Made as a reference to a party member from a DnD campaign I was a part of. It will act aggressively and erratically, in an attempt to simulate the character from the campaign, who also acted erratically and 'malfunctioned'.

## Features
- Unlike the default Rogue Servitor AI, OFSP will is more aggressive and more willing to fight opponents that are equal or even more powerful in strength. 
- It reacts more aggressively to claims made upon it. 
- It is willing to use every method available to acquire additional organics ("Friends"), be it through war or invasion of primitives. 
- It favors armor and hull mods over shields on its ships, and prefers kinetic weapons.
- It has custom dialogues inspired or directly pulled from the aforementioned campaign to give OFSP more 'character', making it even more distinct from the default ROgue Servitor personality. (To be implemented)
