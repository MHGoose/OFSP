 OFSP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Well, you can't be friends with everyone. Luckily we are equipped with a sword arm."

 OFSP_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "You know, We'd love to visit your homeworld some time. Just show our fleet the way."
 OFSP_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Oho, you're approaching us?"
 OFSP_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Oh gosh, are you ugly. Not to worry, ugly friend. We will still take good care of you. Open your borders and let the [Root.GetName] in."

 OFSP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Did you know we speak 400 different languages? Unfortunately, they're all ancient languages so no one else speaks them anymore. Oh well, I'm sure it will come in handy somehow!"
 OFSP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "HAIL! Care for a trade? We have 27 humanoid teeth. Make me your best offer!"
 OFSP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Oh man, you [From.GetSpeciesName]s sure look different to the friends I am used to seeing. Don't worry, we can still be friends!"
